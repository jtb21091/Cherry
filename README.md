# Cherry
Cherry; a moonshot program to monitor, read, and predict blood glucose or interstitial fluids from the eyes

Below are the metrics for the best model compared to CGM benchmarks:

| Metric       | Best Model Value | CGM Benchmark |
|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| RÂ²           | 0.49             | 0.94          |
| MSE          | 1038             | 6.2           |
| MAE          | 25               | 2.1           |
| MARD         | 21%              | 10.5%         |
| Sigma Level  | 0.40             | 3.0           |

As you can see, in current state, it is not very accurate or precise

Keep checking releases as I add more data from myself gathering data
